## Summary

I have little experience in developing various web projects (these are educational projects). At the moment, this is the beginning of the developer's path. I'm going to start working as a web developer.
I have a fundamental university education in the field of information security.

I try to delve into the studied materials in detail and apply them in practice. Interested in sport!
